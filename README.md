# Work Day Scheduler
 - This is a simple work day scheduler. This page works on HTML, CSS, and JQuery. 
 - Depending on the time the schedule will show the color grey for previous timeblock, red for the current timeblock, and green for the future timeblock.
 - When loading into the site for the first time there will be a notice in the middle of the day showing there are no plans. 
 - When scheduling the day by entering an event and hitting the save button. Plans for the day are saved to local storage and will load next time the user opens the site. 
 - I received some help from YouTube channel 'iamrohit' 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW9IfBgKGJKuHhkTognATdg', 'W3Schools' 'https://www.w3schools.com/', and 'jqueryscript.net' 'https://www.jqueryscript.net/'
